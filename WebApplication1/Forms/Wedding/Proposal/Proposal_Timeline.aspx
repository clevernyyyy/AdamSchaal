I arranged so that from the Riveria Maya, we would fly straight back to Omaha.  I thought about the flight from Boston to Riveria Maya would be perfect.  We could visit Lauren and Nicole and that's where I would plan to propose!  I attempted to get ahold of Nicole.</td>

I didn't want anyone to let it slip!  Then you came over and we talked about the whole thing with my grandparents house almost being stolen by a realator.  You encouraged me to call my mom, who while I was on the phone with I let it slip that Lauren and I had sent practically 29 emails to each other.  Then I quickly tried coveraging it up, but my mom knew (since I had gotten her to give me Susan's email address).  Then my mom said "Can't wait to hear what all the emailing was actually about!"  I looked over at you on the couch next to me.  You were looking at emails yourself and hadn't heard.  Phew!</td>

                                            <td>I was so excited on Friday I practically couldn't hold it in.  I messaged Liza to see her opinion on where to propose, she agreed Boston was the place to do it.  We talked for quite a while actually on Facebook chat and she asked if she could tell Joey.  I said of course as long as they could keep a secret!  On Friday I also summarized my tentative plans and sent them to Michael, Lauren, Mom and Dad.  They were all excited for us and me.  Mom kept emailing more and more about the future - I finally had to say "Geez mom, let's get through May first!"  Ha ha.  Nicole contacted me, but I wasn't able to make any plans yet.  My mother suggested a hotel they stayed at in Boston.  It looked pretty decent to me, free breakfast, in the middle of Boston, and decent price.</td>

                                            <td>Meanwhile - I had been asking you a lot of questions so you got suspicious.  The final straw was when I asked you about your passport.  I had to think very quickly and make up a story about my friend from work, Josh and his wife, going on a cruise.  I think you bought it for the time being.  So I pushed it further and asked about where Nicole lived.  Then you pulled out your iPod and we started looking around the globe.  You told me if we were ever to visit her, we should fly into Providence, not Boston.  Interesting, I thought, maybe Providence would be cheaper!  (Saving money was a big deal at this point.)  It was so funny that you talked about visiting the Caribbean because I had just booked the trip two days before!
                                            I looked into Providence, but believe it or not, the flights were actually more expensive!  Plus, I wasn't sure if Nicole would want to spend a bunch of time in Attleboro or Boston since she only got you for one or two days.</td>

                                            <td>On Monday, I've booked our hotel in Boston.  We were able to get a pretty decent rate after some searching, but it's still quite expensive for two nights!  Our hotel has quite the list of amenities, but we likely won't spend much time in the hotel.  I also finally got Nicole to chat with me on Facebook to attempt to make plans.</td>

Soon, much of what I'm writing down will be a part of the website.  You usually don't look at my website, so I haven't bothered to make it hidden yet, but I will soon once I start bringing in features.</td>

My website is really coming together now and I'm super excited to let you and others see it!  I decided streaming live wasn't feasible, but I was still going to make this website as good as possible for our memories.</td>

                                            <td>On Saturday, Nicole informed me that she was no longer available to hang out with us in Boston on 05/04.  It's due to her being schedule to work a month and a half out.  She wants us to travel to Attleboro though to go to restaurants and bars and Foxboro stadium.  I was kind of bummed and since I knew that you likely weren't interested in a football stadium, I asked if she'd compromise and visit us in Boston too.</td>
