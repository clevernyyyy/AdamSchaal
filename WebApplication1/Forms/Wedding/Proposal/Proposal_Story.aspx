                                <p>I suppose the beginning is as good as any place to start the story.  If you've heard this story before feel free to move on, but if you haven't you'll realize how lucky of a man I am for meeting a girl like Colleen.  It was the middle of April 2004.  I had recently starting working at an Applebees by Oakview Mall.  I was interested in a volleyball player at Millard North.  I decided to show up at her volleyball game at Pappillion La-Vista South (a relatively new school back then).  Well when I walked into what I thought was the correct school it was dead empty, no one in the gym at all.  Embarrassed and kind of worried that I was trespassing I took off and got back into my car.  After driving around for another 20 minutes or so I saw an Applebees.  Hungry and tired of looking for the school I decided to stop in to eat and ask for directions.  </p>
                                <p>I was sat near the host stand and ordered some nachos.  I started asking the cute host about Pappillion La-Vista South.  As it happened she had no idea where it was located.  When she told me she went to Millard South I teased her telling her that she should work at my Applebees location since it was much closer to her school.  After some more teasing and talking she agreed that maybe she would want to hang out sometime and asked me for my phone number.  Of course I gave it to her.  Smooth operator that I was at 18, I forgot to ask for her number at that time and before I knew it she actually took off from her shift.  I was a little sad; I thought I had missed an opportunity.</p>

                                <p>In high school I often participated in church plays and activities.  Around this time in May, I was participating in a dinner theatre at my old church St. Tim's on 93rd and Dodge.  During the dinner theatre, while we were serving dinner I believe, my cell phone rang.  I ran off to the bathroom to answer it.  It was Colleen, she had called me finally!  I agreed to pick her up for a party at my friend’s house after the dinner theatre.  As it turns out she was supposed to have a date that night from a guy she'd met online that didn't work out so she called me up.  The dinner theatre took a looong time to finish and help clean up.  Eventually I was already late at picking her up.  I talked the director into letting me take off early so I could go pick her up.  Now I had a dilemma - my character for the theatre was a nerdy guy who wore a sweater vest and some other weird outfits.  All I had was a cutoff T-shirt.   I had to either drive all the way back out west to grab a new shirt or just go pick her up.  I decided on the latter, seeing as I was already a little late.  After getting lost and calling her for directions I eventually got there.</p>
                                <p>Showing up late, with a crummy cutoff t-shirt didn't leave the greatest first impression I'm sure.  But we still went out to my friend Kyle's place.  There were lots of people at his place all having a good time.  I remember specifically one girl who asked, "Who brought the 15 year old?" when referring to 17 yr old Colleen.  Lol, Colleen's always looked young; it's one of her best qualities.  I should've answered, “Her future husband!”  I think that was the night of our first kiss too and we were pretty into each other by the time the night was over.</p>
                                <p>Over the next few days we texted back and forth often and she ended up coming with her friend Dana* to my graduation party.  That is when I realized how excited I was to see her, and how ready I was to exclusively date her.</p>  
                                <p>*Interestingly, Dana was the initial inspiration for Colleen asking for my number</p>

                                <p>Cost and Colleen were both a big reason I stayed in Nebraska for college.  I went to UNO for engineering.  Colleen and I got to hang out quite a bit that first year because I was taking easy courses and she was a senior in high school.  I went to her homecoming and prom with her and had a great time meeting all of her friends.  When she was deciding on her school she eventually chose Iowa Western for radio broadcasting.  Going to school in Iowa made it a little tougher for Colleen and I to ever see each other during the week, but we still maintained a good relationship when we could.</p>

                                <p>After the first few years, she graduated and I was still in school.  She got several radio gigs and was working full-time between all her positions.  We were talking every day at this point.  Eventually, she was about to be dropped from her parent's health insurance and she wanted a more solid job with good benefits.  She got a job at Pentagon Federal Credit Union where she still works today (after several promotions).  In the meantime I had graduated, got laid off, worked odd jobs and looked for work.  I then got a job as a construction superintendent with Hy-Vee Weitz and worked there until I got the job with National Indemnity Company here in Omaha as a software developer.  I am now back in school working towards another Master's degree in Information Assurance and Cyber Security.</p>

I'm thankful for the path that's led us here, however rocky, because it's made us appreciate each other more and more.  I love you honey.</p>
